# PassHaven Password Manager 

## Overview

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) Password Manager that allows users to store, manage, and retrieve their login credentials securely using local storage. The application provides features such as adding, editing, deleting, and exporting accounts, along with a dark mode toggle for better user experience.

## Features

Add, edit, and delete accounts.

Saved accounts can be exported to a text file.

The app has a dark mode toggle.

Data persistence using local storage.

## Technologies Used

HTML - Structuring the web interface.

CSS - Styling and layout design.

JavaScript - Managing the application logic.

## Security Considerations

Local storage is not encrypted, meaning stored passwords are visible in the browser developer tools.

Users should not use this for highly sensitive credentials.

## Future Improvements

Implement encryption for stored passwords.

Allow credentials to be imported.

Add authentication.

Add a feature that analyses password strength

Use cloud storage to sync data across devices/browsers
